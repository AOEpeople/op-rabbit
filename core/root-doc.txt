Please see the README on [[https://github.com/SpinGo/op-rabbit]] for an overview.

==Configuration==

Set up RabbitMQ connection information in `application.conf`:

{{{
rabbitmq {
  topic-exchange-name = "op-rabbit-testeroni"
  hosts = ["127.0.0.1"]
  username = "guest"
  password = "guest"
  port = 5672
  connection-timeout = 3s
  virtual-host = "/"
}
}}}

==Usage==

Boot up the [[com.spingo.op_rabbit.RabbitControl RabbitControl]] actor:

{{{
implicit val actorSystem = ActorSystem("such-system")
val rabbitMq = actorSystem.actorOf(Props[RabbitControl])
}}}

==Set up a [[com.spingo.op_rabbit.AsyncAckingConsumer Consumer]]: ([[com.spingo.op_rabbit.TopicBinding Topic subscription]])==

(this example uses `op-rabbit-play-json`)

{{{
import com.spingo.op_rabbit.PlayJsonSupport._
import com.spingo.op_rabbit._
import com.spingo.op_rabbit.consumer._
import com.spingo.op_rabbit.subscription.Directives._

import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
implicit val personFormat = Json.format[Person] // setup play-json serializer

val subscription = new Subscription {
  // A qos of 3 will cause up to 3 concurrent messages to be processed at any given time.
  def config = channel(qos = 3) {
    consume(topic("such-message-queue", List("some-topic.#"))) {
      body(as[Person]) { person =>
        // do work; this body is executed in a separate thread, as provided by the implicit execution context
        ack()
      }
    }
  }
}

rabbitMq ! subscription
}}}

Note, if your call generates an additional future, you can pass it to ack, and message will be acked based off the Future success, and nacked if the Future fails:

{{{
      body(as[Person]) { person =>
        // do work; this body is executed in a separate thread, as provided by the implicit execution context
        val result: Future[Unit] = myApi.methodCall(person)
        ack(result)
      }

}}}

See [[com.spingo.op_rabbit.Subscription Subscription]]

===Accessing additional headers===

If there are other headers you'd like to access, you can extract multiple using nested functions, or combine multiple directives to a single one. IE:

{{{
import com.spingo.op_rabbit.properties._

// Nested directives
// ...
      body(as[Person]) { person =>
        optionalProperty(ReplyTo) { replyTo =>
          // do work
          ack()
        }
      }
// ...

// Compound directive
// ...
      (body(as[Person]) & optionalProperty(ReplyTo)) { (person, replyTo) =>
        // do work
        ack()
      }
// ...
}}}

Please see the documentation on [[com.spingo.op_rabbit.consumer.Directives Directives]] for more details.

===Shutting down a consumer===

The following methods are available on subscription which will allow control over the subscription.

{{{
// stop receiving new messages from RabbitMQ immediately; shut down consumer and channel as soon as pending messages are completed. A grace period of 30 seconds is given, after which the subscription forcefully shuts down.
subscription.close(30 seconds)

// Shut things down without a grace period
subscription.abort()

// Future[Unit] which completes once the provided binding has been applied (IE: queue has been created and topic bindings configured). Useful if you need to assert you don't send a message before a message queue is created in which to place it.
subscription.initialized

// Future[Unit] which completes when the subscription is closed.
subscription.closed

// Future[Unit] which completes when the subscription begins closing.
subscription.closing
}}}

==Publish a message==

{{{
rabbitMq ! TopicMessage(Person(name = "Mike How", age = 33), routingKey = "some-topic.very-interest")

rabbitMq ! QueueMessage(Person(name = "Ivanah Tinkle", age = 25), queue = "such-message-queue")
}}}

By default:

- Messages will be queued up until a connection is available
- Messages are monitored via publisherConfirms; if a connection is lost before RabbitMQ confirms receipt of the message, then the message is published again. This means that the message may be delivered twice, the default opinion being that `at-least-once` is better than `at-most-once`. You can use `UnconfirmedMessage` if you'd like `at-most-once` delivery instead.
- If you would like to be notified of confirmation, use the ask pattern:

      {{{scala
        val received = (rabbitMq ? QueueMessage(Person(name = "Ivanah Tinkle", age = 25), queue = "such-message-queue")).mapTo[Boolean]
      }}}

==Consuming using Akka streams==

(this example uses `op-rabbit-play-json` and `op-rabbit-akka-streams`)

{{{
import com.spingo.op_rabbit._
import com.spingo.op_rabbit.subscription._
import com.spingo.op_rabbit.subscription.Directives._
import com.spingo.op_rabbit.PlayJsonSupport._
implicit val workFormat = Json.format[Work] // setup play-json serializer

val publisher = RabbitSource(
  rabbitMq,
  channel(qos = 3),
  consume(queue("such-queue", durable = true, exclusive = false, autoDelete = false)),
  body(as[Work])) // marshalling is automatically hooked up using implicits

Source(publisher).
  to(Sink.foreach {
    case (ackPromise, work) =>
      doWork(work)
      ackPromise.success() // fulfilling the promise causes the message to be acknowledge and removed from the queue
  })
  .run
}}}

== Publishing using Akka streams ==

(this example uses `op-rabbit-play-json` and `op-rabbit-akka-streams`)

{{{
import com.spingo.op_rabbit._
import com.spingo.op_rabbit.PlayJsonSupport._
implicit val workFormat = Format[Work] // setup play-json serializer

val sink = RabbitSink[Work](
  "my-sink-name",
  rabbitMq,
  GuaranteedPublishedMessage(QueuePublisher("such-queue")))

Source(1 to 15).
  map { i => (Promise[Unit], i) }.  // each promise will be completed by the sink when message delivery occurs
  to(sink)
  .run
}}}

== Error Notification ==

It's important to know when your consumers fail. Out of the box, `op-rabbit` ships with support for logging to `logback` (and therefore syslog) via [[com.spingo.op_rabbit.LogbackLogger LogbackLogger]], and also `airbrake` via `op-rabbit-airbrake`. Without any additional signal provided by you, logback will be used, making error visibility a default.

You can report errors to multiple sources by combining error logging strategies; for example, if you'd like to report to both `logback` and to `airbrake`, import / set the following implicit RabbitErrorLogging in the scope where your consumer is instantiated:

{{{
import com.spingo.op_rabbit.{LogbackLogger, RabbitControl}

implicit val rabbitErrorLogging = LogbackLogger + AirbrakeLogger.fromConfig
}}}

Implementing your own error reporting strategy is simple; see [[com.spingo.op_rabbit.LogbackLogger]]:
